# Calculate stellar parameters using deep networks

This repository contains the code that was used to calculate the stellar parameters in XXX.
If you plan to use this code, please cite the following paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03639](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03639)

## Requirements

- Tensorflow (tested and run on version 1.4.0)
- TFLearn (tested and run on version 0.3.2)
- The trained model code ([download here](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/research-projects/spaceinn/spaceinn) and paste in the models folder)
- To run the notebook: Jupyter, matplotlib and tqdm

You can install specific versions using pip with for example `pip install tensorflow==1.4.0`. It is recommended to run tensorflow with a GPU, please refer to the tensorflow documentation to set it up.
